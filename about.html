            <p style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: -28px; margin-bottom: -16px;"><b>Lee Swee Yeong</b></p>
            <p>Lee Swee Yeong, the founder of Arthematic, brings a wealth of expertise from the fields of broadcasting and advertising. With over 12 years of experience as a production designer at Astro TV, Lee specialized in designing and building dynamic set designs for television productions. His background in advertising refined his rapid sketching and visualization skills, a talent he further honed while working under Malaysia’s creative pioneer, the late Tan Sri Dato’ Dr. Lim Kok Wing, as a visualizer in his ad agency.
            </p>
            <p>
            During his time at Astro, Lee served as a senior production designer, creating iconic TV sets for popular shows like Wheel of Fortune, Deal or No Deal, Astro Talent Quest, Miss Astro Beauty Pageant, Academy Fantasia, and many other celebrated entertainment productions. His strong visualization skills allow him to transform abstract ideas into artist impressions and bring them to life.
            <br><br>
            Now, Lee channels his extensive experience in broadcast and visual arts into Arthematic, an art academy dedicated to inspiring future generations. Through Arthematic, he aims to pass on his knowledge, encouraging young learners to explore their creativity and benefit from the same skills that defined his career.

        <h1 class="rightText">About Arthematic</h1>
        <p  class="rightText">ArThematic is an innovative, integrated art and science discovery program crafted for the 21st-century child. It’s designed to nurture the next generation of creative thinkers and visionary leaders. Through a blend of art and subjects like animal and marine geography, human activities, sci-fi, fantasy worlds, space exploration, cultural traditions, and festivals, ArThematic serves as a dynamic “art cyclopedia.”
            <br><br>
            Our program seamlessly weaves visual drawing, model creation, comic storyboarding, and public speaking into a comprehensive learning journey. Students begin by transforming ideas into vivid 2D artwork, then advance to creating precise 3D models. Finally, they bring their learning full circle by crafting storyboards, turning their topics into engaging stories, and building confidence through public speaking. With ArThematic, young learners don’t just explore knowledge—they turn it into art, stories, and ideas ready to share with the world.</p>

        <h1>Why choose Arthematic?</h1>
        <p class="bottomFill">Arthematic offers a unique, integrated approach to learning that combines the creative world of art with the explorative nature of science. Through a blend of visual art, model-making, and comic storyboarding, Arthematic brings extra value and excitement to each lesson by connecting art with topics like scientific discovery, space, and geography. This distinct programming flow is designed to engage kids fully, encouraging them to explore skills like problem-solving and creative thinking in an immersive way.
            <br><br>
            In Arthematic, kids experience the thrill of transforming their ideas from 2D drawings into 3D models, tackling real-world, hands-on challenges that foster logical reasoning. By creating storyboards, children are encouraged to think independently, find solutions, and express themselves visually and verbally. Arthematic’s emphasis on application means that students learn practical skills they can apply beyond the classroom, equipping them with tools to improve their understanding of the world and to enrich their daily lives.</p>

        <p  class="rightText">The Arthematic Program is a unique and comprehensive art and science learning experience, structured around five core programs: Visual Art, Crafty Clay (Model Making), Comic Storyboard, STEAM KiDZ, Digital Art, and Fine Art. Each component brings essential skills and creative expression together to form a dynamic, well-rounded curriculum. Driven by themes, Arthematic’s programming covers three key focus areas: 
            <br>
            <b style="font-size: 20px;">Innovation Month</b>
            <br>
            Science Innovation Month introduces topics like space exploration, the solar system, rockets, and space shuttles, sparking curiosity and understanding of our universe. 
            <br>
            <b style="font-size: 20px;">Thematic Month</b>
            <br>
            Thematic Art Month engages students with broader themes such as geography, human activities, cultural traditions, and festive celebrations, enriching their global awareness. 
            <br>
            <b style="font-size: 20px;">Inspiration Month</b>
            <br>
            Finally, Inspiration Month taps into sci-fi and fantasy worlds, encouraging imaginative thinking and storytelling. These themes form the DNA of Arthematic, creating a balanced and stimulating environment where young minds can explore, create, and bring ideas to life across multiple forms of art.</p>
